# VisualTimebar
Picture Chronology / for creating a visual diary

The basic idea of this package is to organize visual data on a timebar.
To this purpose the <a href = "https://github.com/almende/vis">vis timeline library</a> was used, as well as the <a href = "https://github.com/Phalanstere/ClusterPainter">cluster painter module</a> that dislays time clustered images.
