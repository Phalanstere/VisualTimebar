# VisualTimeline
Picture Chronology / a tool that can be used as a visual diary or an image organizer

The basic idea of this package is to organize visual data on a timeline.
To this purpose the <a href = "https://github.com/almende/vis">vis timeline library</a> was used, as well as the <a href = "https://github.com/Phalanstere/ClusterPainter">cluster painter module</a> that dislays time clustered images.

For simlicities sake - there are so many dependencies involved - the libary was conceived as an npm module that can be installed easily, via:

```html
	npm install visual-diary
```
But soon there will be a conventional *.js libary added that works with a singe minified file.

However, to get a decent display, there is a css to be added:

```html

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/visual-timeline/css/visualTimeline.css">

```
